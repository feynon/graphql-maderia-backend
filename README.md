# graphql-maderia-backend
An experimental GraphQL tooling collection.

**maderia** aims to be a comprehensive tool for anything related on GraphQL tooling.

**maderia** came out as an idea for having all commonly used graphql tooling at one site instead of socrching and setting up yet an another library.
